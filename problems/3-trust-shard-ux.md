# 3. Trust Shard User Experience

## Problem Description

**How can we create a trust shard system that fulfills the following user experience
requirements?**

- Users can prove ownership of a shard from any computing device they wish to use. This is an
  affordance provided by current username and password systems, you can log in from any computer
  because you authenticate based on something you know.
- The use of the underlying technology used to represent trust shards should be invisible to actors
  using the system. For example, when asymmteric cryptography is used, the users in question should
  not be responsible for making their own keypair from the terminal.
