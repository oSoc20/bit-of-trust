# 4. Trust Shard Capabilities

## Problem Description

**What should people with a trust shard be able to do?**

Currently this is:

- Sending invites to new actors who want to join the relationship
- Revoking shards from actors who are no longer considered part of a relationship

What are other actions that should be supported? (i.e. defining the context in which a relationship
takes place, like a work environment, etc.) This is also related to
[5-trust-descr.md](/problems/5-trust-description.md), since the structure of what a trust relation
is, heavily depends on what actors are able to impact about it.
